## Inspiration
Have you ever received a concert flyer or a graphical timeline, hoping to add it to your calendar, but finding it too tedious to add them event to event. This is the exact problem we are inspired by and want to solve.
## What it does
What KronAI does is it drastically simplifies this workflow by combining every action into one click. All you need to do is take a picture, screenshot, or upload from gallery, and KronAI will take care of the scheduling for you. But KronAI is more than that. Utilizing Perplexity and ChromaDB, KronAI's scheduling assistant can capture the nuances of your schedule just like your own personal secretary!
## How we built it
We built the software using Next.js, integrating with Gemini, Perplexity, Google Calendar, and Chromadb. Oauth is used for login.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges when we tried to integrate APIs such as Google's OAuth and calendar.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that when we talk to people about our idea, many people say they experience the exact problem we are solving and say that they would love to use a product like this. This means we are working in the right direction, and we are proud to work on something that solve the little inconveniences in life.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about the process of how to integrate the APIs we used into our application.
## What's next for KronAI
Integration with G-mail to autodetect events and schedule events automatically.
